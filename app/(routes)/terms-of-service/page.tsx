            transactions, you are assuming. PRINT3R.xyz does not own or control
            any underlying software through which blockchain networks are
            formed. The software underlying blockchain networks are open-source
            so anyone can use, copy, modify, and distribute it. By using the
            Interface, you acknowledge and agree:
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">

              That PRINT3R.xyz is not responsible for the operation of the

            </li>

              operating rules, such as those commonly referred to as
              &quot;forks,&quot; which may materially affect the Interface. You
              are responsible for securing your private key(s). We do not have
              access to your private key(s); losing control of your private
              key(s) will permanently and irreversibly deny you access to any
              blockchain-based network. Neither PRINT3R.xyz nor any other person
              or entity will be able to retrieve or protect your digital assets.
              If your private key(s) are lost, you will not be able to transfer
              your digital assets to any blockchain address or wallet. If this
              occurs, you will not be able to realize any value or utility from

            6.3. You understand that the Arbitrum and Avalanche blockchain

            channels. The notice must (a) describe the nature and basis of the
            claim and (b) set forth the specific relief sought. Our notice to
            you will be similar in form to that described above. If you and
            PRINT3R.xyz cannot reach an agreement to resolve the claim within
            sixty (60) days of your email, then you and PRINT3R.xyz agree to

            Any claim or controversy arising out of or relating to the Site, the

            Corte Civil y Mercantil de Arbitraje (CIMA). You understand that you
            are required to resolve all Disputes by binding arbitration. The
            arbitration shall be confidential before a single arbitrator, who
            shall be selected pursuant to the CIMA rules. The arbitration will
            be held in Madrid, Spain, unless you and we both agree to hold it
            elsewhere. Unless we agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not
            consolidate your claims with those of any other party. Any judgment
            on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court
            of competent jurisdiction.
